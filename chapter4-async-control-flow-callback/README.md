# Asynchronous Control Flow Patterns with Callbacks

In this chapter, you will see how it's actually possible to tame callbacks and write clean, manageable asynchronous code by using same discipline and with the aid of some patterns.
In short, you will learn about:

- The changllenges of asynchronous programming.
- Avoiding callback hell and other callback best practices.
- Common asynchronous patterns such as sequential execution, sequential iteration, parallel execution, and limited parallel execution.

**Note: Simply use (Async.js)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/async] to control asynchronous invocation flow.**
